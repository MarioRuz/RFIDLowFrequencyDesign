# RFIDLowFrequencyDesign
This code is provided as supplementary material to the submitted paper "Accident prevention in agricultural machinery using radiofrequency technology: A prototype application to olive net collectors". The code allows calculating the number of loops for a given planar geometry and a specific inductance value. The inductance is a key parameter of inductive coupling antennas. The code will be released once the submitted paper is accepted.
