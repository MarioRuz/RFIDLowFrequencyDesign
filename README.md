# RFIDLowFrequencyDesign
This code is provided as supplementary material to the submitted paper "Accident prevention in agricultural machinery using radiofrequency technology: A prototype application to olive net collectors". The code allows calculating the number of loops for a given planar geometry and a specific inductance value. The inductance is a key parameter of inductive coupling antennas.

VotalgeDependenc.m shows the dependency with speed velocity and applied voltage to the RFID antenna.

The information contained in the folders is as follows:
/AntennaInductanceEstimation contains the matlab scripts for the estimation of number of turns to meet 27 uH

/RoboticTesting contains the datasets from experiments carried out with the robotic experimental approach
