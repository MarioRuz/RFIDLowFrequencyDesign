% Description: This script estimates the antenna inductance
% for three possible plannar geometries: rectangular, circular and spiral
% circular. Additionally, it provides the closest number of turns that
% gives the closest value to 27 uH.
%
% The code consists of five files:
% menu.m: This menu allows selecting the antenna geometry.
%
% rectangular.m: Script that provides the inductance as a function of the 
% number of turns for a planar rectangular coil and the number of turns 
% that gives the closest value to 27 ÂµH.
%
% circular.m: same that rectangular.m for a circular geommetry.
%
% spiral.m: same that rectangular.m for a circular geommetry.
%
% numberOfturns.m: function that provides the number of turns that 
% gives the closest value to 27 uH.
